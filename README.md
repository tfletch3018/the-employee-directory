# The Employee Directory
## Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- The task was to create an employee directory utilizing React. 
- This needed to be accomplished by first separating the application UI into components, then managing the componet while responding to user events
- The employee directory is a useful tool for both employees and managers that enables both to quickly access information regarding coworkers  
- There was much more exposure to React with this project. An open-source, front-end, Java Script Library maintained by Facebook and a community of developers, React is distinguished by its unique focus on state management and rendering that state to the DOM. As a reuslt, the majority of React applications typically require the utilization of additional libraries to manage routing, as well as certain client-side functionality. Axios, React-Dom and React-Router-Dom are few of the libraries incorporated in this specific application that I was less familiar with and learned more about from this exercise.

## User Story
* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 
The user should be able to:
  * Sort the table by at least one category
  * Filter the users by at least one property.
